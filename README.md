# React ES6 Webpack Karma Boilerplate

Boilerplate for kick starting a project with the following technologies:
* [React](https://github.com/facebook/react)
* [ES6 with Babel](http://babeljs.io)
* [Webpack](http://webpack.github.io) for bundling
* [Webpack Dev Server](http://webpack.github.io/docs/webpack-dev-server.html)
* [React Hot Loader](http://gaearon.github.io/react-hot-loader/) for tweaking React components in real time.
* [Karma](http://karma-runner.github.io/0.13/index.html) for running unit tests.

The various webpack options used have been explained in detailed as comments in the config file. Should help with understanding the nitty-gritty :)

Based on [react-es6-webpack-boilerplate](https://github.com/vasanthk/react-es6-webpack-boilerplate).

### Usage

```
npm install
npm start
# Open http://localhost:5000
```

### Linting

ESLint with React linting options have been enabled.

### Testing

Start Karma test runner.

This will run the tests only one, ideal for CI (travis and such).

This will auto watch all files for changes and rerun the tests. Ideal for development.
